# Hello World

The purpose of this repository is to help people get familiar with creating pull requests, and to similarily recreate helloworldcollection.de.

For Hacktober 2018, we are encouraging students to open pull requests to add their favorite languages, and get started with opening pull requests.

5. Once you've cloned your forked repository to your local machine, open the folder in an editor of your choice. From here, create a new folder with the title of the language you're going to add. For example, we're adding Go, so we created a folder called "go". Inside this folder we have:

- All code required to run our hello world.
- A [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) Readme file containing steps to run our hello world.
- A screenshot of the hello world running on our machine.

7. If we go back to the Github webpage showing our code, and refresh the page, we'll notice that our new folder is there, with everything we added. Now we can open a pull request.
